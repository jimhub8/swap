                <p>So you have all your top products uploaded on your Web Shop, you’ve shared links to all your
                    social media networks, and boom! You get your first order! Don’t panic, here’s what you need to
                    know to make sure it goes as smoothly as possible:
                    .Packaging: You know your product is awesome, so ensure that you put it in an awesome
                    package! We recommend clean, new, gift bags with your branding printed on it. Recognition of
                    your brand when sending out products is important. But not to worry, if you don’t have
                    branded packaging, then any brand new gift bags like in the picture below will do.
                    .Timely Delivery: Dellmat promises customers within Nairobi fast &amp; safe delivery, sometimes
                    as quick as 2 hours! So if you don’t want to disappoint your customers, then ensure that you
                    have your product packaged and ready for dispatch the moment you get your order. Our
                    customer service agents will notify you with the name of the delivery rider that will come and
                    collect the product from your shop.
                    .User Reviews: Every customer that buys from you will be asked to rate your services and write
                    a review on your Web Shop. This review will be public for other potential customers to see
                    before they make an order with you. It is important that you keep this in mind when
                    dispatching your products.
                    .Payment: Dellmat pays merchants immediately the customer approves the product they have
                    received. The product will be delivered to the customer, they will review that it’s what they
                    wanted, and give authorization for the payment to be made to the merchant. If the product is
                    not accepted then it will immediately delivered back to the you, the merchant, at no cost to you.
                    So ensure that you dispatch exactly what the customer ordered!</p>
