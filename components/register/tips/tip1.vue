                <p>Most e-commerce sellers believe that what’s important is the product they’re selling and the
                    features it holds. However research has shown that your product’s packaging and how it’s
                    perceived can go a long way.</p>

                <ul class="list-group">
                    <li class="list-group-item">Sending customers gift-like, printed brown or white fancier looking packaging exceeds customer expectations and creates a memorable experience.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">The excitement created by premium packaging drives customers to post pictures of your products on their social media and attract their friends and followers to check out your web shop.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">Customers look at what has been posted by their peers on social media when they’re researching their next purchase.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">There’s potential for consumers posting unpacking/unboxing videos online for others to see if they’re impressed with your packaging.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">Poor packaging has a huge impact on how your actual product is perceived. Many customers may assume they’re receiving a faulty or used item.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In other words it’s super important that your packaging says something about you and your brand!</p>
