                <p>Customers have increasingly demanding needs and will be hesitant to buy from you unless you
                    meet those needs. Customers today have plenty of websites on the internet that they can visit
                    to find products similar to you, that’s why it’s important that you write very good descriptions
                    for your products outlining all its features and benefits.</p>
                <b>The 3 things you have to have in your description before posting ANY product are:</b>
                <ol>
                    <li>General description of the product e.g. Classic long sleeved dress shirt, with one front pocket,
                        two shoulder pleats and buttoned collar.</li>
                    <li>Details about quality, size, performance. E.g. 100% cotton, available in sizes small, medium,
                        large and extra-large.</li>
                    <li>The benefits of using the product e.g. soft, wrinkle-free fabric makes these hassle-free shirts
                        ideal for the office.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Detailed descriptions are important, but also ensure not too make it too long as well. Keep it,
                    simple, short and straight to the point!</p>
                <strong>NB: Remember to proof read your descriptions for spelling and grammatical mistakes before posting!</strong>
