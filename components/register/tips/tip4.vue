                <p>As a small business owner, you can’t afford to ignore Facebook as a sales channel. As many
                    people use the web to search for more businesses, most of them will use Facebook. So it’s
                    important that you take advantage of the world’s leading social media platform to promote
                    your business and your products.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Create a Page:</b> If you don’t already have a functional Facebook page, start by creating one. A page is simply your business’ home base, it’s a like a regular Facebook profile but for your business. Ensure that the page reflects your brand by uploading your business logo as your profile picture and the right cover photo as well.</li>
                    <li><b>Build an audience:</b> No one is going to see your
                        content until you start getting fans and followers on your page. Luckily Facebook has some
                        features to help you build your audience and promote your page so take advantage of those
                        features from day 1!</li>
                    <li><b>Share!</b> Your posts are going to show up on your followers timelines, so don’t hold back! Share some engaging content highlighting your business, your activities and your products.</li>
                    <li><b>Consider promoted posts:</b> Facebook also offers advertising tools that allows you to drive
                        traffic to your Dellmat web shop and products. First create a normal post on your Facebook
                        page timeline, and then select ‘BOOST POST’, select a budget and paste your Dellmat web shop
                        link as the advert destination.</li>
