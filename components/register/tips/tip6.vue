                <p>Instagram is one of the world’s leading social media platforms to get your name out there and
                    build your brand. It’s a great way to build your brand and increase engagement with your
                    followers.
                    If you’re already sharing your content and products on your Instagram page, all that’s left to do
                    is place your Dellmat web shop link in your BIO and direct your follows to click on it to be able
                    to purchase from you.</p><br>
                <p>If you don’t have an instagram account yet, simply download the Instagram app here and
                    create an account. Start by following other brands that inspire you, and also following their
                    followers because these are people who would be more inclined to follow you back.</p>
