                <ol>
                    <li><b>Studio shoot</b> there are lots of studios in Nairobi for various price ranges that take amazing product shots. A
                        studio shot is a clear way to show potential customers what you’re selling. When shoppers browse through
                        products, they’re drawn to clear, bright photos that show off the product. Clear photos help set a realistic
                        expectation of what a customer will be receiving, helping you to avoid the hassle of returns and exchanges.</li>
                    <li><b>White background shortcuts</b> if you don’t have access to a photography studio, not to worry! All you need
                        is a good digital camera or just your camera phone, a white background, and natural light. The white
                        background could be anything from an actual white wall, a large piece of white Manila paper, or a white sheet.
                        Place the background and your product in front of, or next to some natural light coming in from a window.
                        One thing to note is that you need to keep your background neat and simple at all costs not to steal attention
                        away from your product.</li>
                    <li><b>Take outdoor pictures with natural light</b> shooting outdoors is a great way to give your product
                        photography some creative perspective. Use the environment around you e.g. brick walls, greenery etc. to
                        complement your product’s features. Furthermore the hours at sunrise or sunset, also known as the ‘golden
                        hours’ are best to bring out the colors and texture of your photography.</li>
                    <li><b>The more angles, the better!</b> You want your shoppers to understand exactly what they’re buying so it’s up
                        to you to communicate all the best features of your product. Do this by taking photos of the different angles of
                        your product</li>
                    <li><b>Photo editing software</b> Make use of photo editing software to get your pictures just right is the last mile to
                        product photography. Some really great photo editing apps you can download on your smartphone for free
                        include: Snapseed, Inshot, VSCO, Pixlr</li>
